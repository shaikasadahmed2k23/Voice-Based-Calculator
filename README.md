Description: A voice-based calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by speaking the numbers and operation.
Features:
Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize spoken input.
Uses pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion to provide audio feedback.
Incorporates error handling for robust user interaction.
Functionality:
Asks the user to speak the first and second numbers separately, recognizing each input and converting it to an integer.
Prompts the user to speak the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) they want to perform.
Based on the operation chosen, calculates and speaks the result.
Developed a voice-based calculator in Python using speech_recognition and pyttsx3.
Implemented speech recognition for user input and text-to-speech for audio feedback.
Added robust error handling for a smooth user experience.
Supported arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users can speak the numbers and operation to perform calculations verbally.
